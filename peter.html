        <h1>My First Marriage</h1>

            <h2>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h2>
            <p>It was December 2023, a time of great loss and deep despair. Floods had ravaged Garissa, leaving me with nothing - no clothes, no possessions, only the will to begin again. During this period, while at Hallmark Supermarket where I worked, I saw her - Vincencia Masea, a Kenchic merchandiser.</p>
            <p>Our eyes met. We exchanged contacts. I learned she lived in Matuu. I needed clothes, and I trusted her enough to send her some cash. On her return to Garissa, we met at Killas Lodge. What struck me wasn't just the clothes she bought with my money - it was the extra pair she bought using her own. That gesture, simple yet profound, touched me. I saw care. I saw kindness. I saw someone different.</p>
            <p class="highlight">That night, I went back to my house with a mind full of questions and a heart curious about this woman who had stepped into my storm with warmth.</p>
            <p>When she was in Garissa, I'd visit her again at Killas Lodge. Days came and went, and my interest grew deeper.</p>

        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="page-number">===== Page 2 =====</div>
            <h2>Chapter 2: Growing Closer</h2>
            <p>In March 2024, my grandmother (Cucu) passed away. It was a painful time. To my surprise, Vincencia came for the funeral. Her presence, her support - it meant everything. It showed me just how much she cared.</p>
            <p>After the burial, she invited me to visit her home in Matuu town. That's when I met her daughter, Gabriella Amor - beautiful, bright, in Grade 2 at Parochial School. Just like her mother, I loved her instantly.</p>
            <p>Three days later, I returned to Garissa. Our conversations deepened. Later that same March, she came back to Garissa - not to a lodge this time, but to my home. That marked the end of Killas Lodge in our story.</p>
            <p class="highlight">We talked about staying together. But how could we? One lived in Garissa, the other in Matuu. Someone had to make a sacrifice.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="page-number">===== Page 3 =====</div>
            <h2>Chapter 3: A New Home in Matuu</h2>
            <p>She had a business - Vimax Kuku Shop - and also worked at Kenchic. I worked at Hallmark Supermarket. In August 2024, I made my decision. I left Garissa, left my job, and joined her in Matuu. I began working at the Vimax Kuku Shop. From that point, we were husband and wife in everything but name.</p>
            <p>But with time came challenges.</p>
            <p>My struggles: mental health, depression, and diet-related diseases. Her struggles: back pain, leg pain, stomach cyst.</p>
            <p class="highlight">Then came the worst - the loss of an unborn child.</p>
            <p>We began to feel more and more distant.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="chapter">
            <div class="page-number">===== Page 4 =====</div>
            <h2>Chapter 4: Challenges and Separation</h2>
            <p>I began to feel disrespected. There were long daily calls with the BO guy. I didn't feel loved. My health declined, and I barely ate well.</p>
            <p>She, too, felt unloved - I didn't talk to her as often. She felt I was irresponsible, especially for not finishing medications. She accused me of cheating - with female customers at Vimax, Shiku in Garissa, a KCB girl, Musakulu in Bungoma. She said I was rude, inattentive.</p>
            <p>By May 2025, the tension had become unbearable. One morning, she called Anko Gitau from Nakuru for a talk. The following day, she asked for separation. She believed things would never improve.</p>
            <p class="highlight">And that's how our story ended.</p>

            <div class="page-number">===== Page 5 =====</div>
            <h2>Chapter 5: Memories Worth Keeping</h2>
            <p>Despite the challenges, our time together had unforgettable moments.</p>
            <p>Sister Triza came to help Vincencia at the Vimax Kuku Shop and stayed for about five months. She had her fair share of complaints and at times caused tension, but she was part of our journey.</p>
            <p>When I moved to Matuu, she surprised me with a welcome-home birthday celebration. Clara's birthday on December 25, 2024, was full of joy. We attended Njeri's wedding on December 12 and danced like a happy couple.</p>
            <p>In early 2025, I was admitted at Kenyatta Hospital due to chest caving. I felt weak, but she stood by me. She also suffered, and I took her to Parochial Health Centre when her pain was too much.</p>
            <p class="highlight">These memories, both joyful and painful, are part of our journey.</p>

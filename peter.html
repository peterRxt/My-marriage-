                <h3>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h3>
                <p>It was December 2023, a time of great loss and deep despair. Floods had ravaged Garissa, leaving me with nothing—only the will to begin again. At Hallmark Supermarket, I met Vincencia Masea, a Kenchic merchandiser.</p>
                <p>We exchanged contacts. I learned she lived in Matuu. I needed clothes, and I trusted her enough to send her some cash. She returned to Garissa with not just the clothes I asked for—but an extra pair she paid for herself. That simple gesture touched me. I saw care. I saw kindness. I saw someone different.</p>
                <p>We met at Killas Lodge. That night, I returned home with a heart full of curiosity about this woman who had stepped into my storm with warmth.</p>
                <p>When she was in Garissa again, I would visit her at Killas Lodge. Days passed, and my interest grew deeper.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 5: Memories Worth Keeping</h3>
                <p>Despite the challenges, our time together had unforgettable moments:</p>
                <ul class="memory-list">
                    <li>❤️ Sister Triza came to help Vincencia at the Vimax Kuku Shop and stayed for about five months.</li>
                    <li>🎂 When I moved to Matuu, she surprised me with a welcome-home birthday celebration.</li>
                    <li>🎄 Clara's birthday on December 25, 2024, was full of joy.</li>
                    <li>💃 We attended Njeri's wedding on December 12, 2024, and danced like a happy couple.</li>
                    <li>🏥 In early 2025, I was admitted to Kenyatta Hospital due to chest caving.</li>
                    <li>💊 She also suffered health issues, and I took her to Parochial Health Centre.</li>
                    <li>😠 Jacob at Kenchic. I never liked him.</li>
                    <li>📱 There was also the BO guy—always calling, always present.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>💍 In March 2024, I asked her if it was okay to marry from the Kisii tribe. She said, "It's okay, go ahead." That answer guided my decision to build a life with her.</p>
                <p>💑 I called her KAMUMMY she called me BABE, anko called her mama Vince dad called her Nyanduko!!</p>
                <p class="the-end">THE END!!</p>
